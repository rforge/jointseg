=================
Version: 0.6.3 [2014-10-27]
o Submission to CRAN

Version: 0.6.2 [2014-09-09]

o Updates to CITATION.

Version: 0.6.1 [2014-07-16]
o In 'estimateSd': SPEED UP for method "Hall": vectorization.

 on initial segmentation.  Default behavior of the functions is
 unchanged.

default), frequencies of regions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1) and (1,2) (the
most common alterations) are set to represent 90% of the regions.

Version: 0.6.0 [2014-06-18]
