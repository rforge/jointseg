Title: Joint segmentation of multivariate (copy number) signals
Version: 0.5.1

Author: Morgane Pierre-Jean and Pierre Neuvial
Maintainer: Morgane Pierre-Jean <morgane.pierrejean@genopole.cnrs.fr>
Description: This package implements functions to quickly segment multivariate signals into piecewise constant profiles and a framework to generate realistic copy-number profiles.  A typical application is the joint segmentation of total DNA copy numbers and allelic ratios obtained from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) microarrays in cancer studies.
