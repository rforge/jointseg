Description: This package implements functions to quickly segment multivariate signals into piecewise constant profiles. A typical application is the joint segmentation of total DNA copy numbers and allelic ratios obtained from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) microarrays in cancer studies.  We use a two step approach where the first step (over-)segments the signal using recursive binary segmentation, and the second step prunes candiate change points obtained at the first step using dynamic programming.
