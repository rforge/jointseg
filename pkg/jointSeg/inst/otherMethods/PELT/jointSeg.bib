@article{peiffer06high-resolution,
	Abstract = {Array-CGH is a powerful tool for the detection of
chromosomal aberrations.
The introduction of high-density SNP genotyping technology to genomic
profiling, termed SNP-CGH, represents a further advance, since simultaneous
measurement of both signal intensity variations and changes in allelic
composition makes it possible to detect both copy number changes
and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. We demonstrate
the utility of SNP-CGH with two Infinium whole-genome genotyping
BeadChips, assaying 109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal
aberrations in samples bearing constitutional aberrations as well
tumor samples at sub-100 kb effective resolution. Detected aberrations
include homozygous deletions, hemizygous deletions, copy-neutral
LOH, duplications, and amplifications. The statistical ability to
detect common aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome
titration model system, and sensitivity was modeled by titration
of gDNA from a tumor cell with that of its paired normal cell line.
Analysis was facilitated by using a genome browser that plots log
ratios of normalized intensities and allelic ratios along the chromosomes.
We developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample and a
paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes log intensity
ratios and allelic ratios by referencing to canonical genotype clusters
generated from approximately 120 reference samples, whereas the paired
sample mode uses a paired normal reference sample from the same individual.
Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and contrasted for their
utility in analyzing different types of input gDNA: low input amounts,
fragmented gDNA, and Phi29 whole-genome pre-amplified DNA.},

@article{lai05comparative,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) can reveal chromosomal aberrations in the genomic DNA. These amplifications and deletions at the DNA level are important in the pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases. While a large number of approaches have been proposed for analyzing the large array CGH datasets, the relative merits of these methods in practice are not clear. RESULTS: We compare 11 different algorithms for analyzing array CGH data. These include both segment detection methods and smoothing methods, based on diverse techniques such as mixture models, Hidden Markov Models, maximum likelihood, regression, wavelets and genetic algorithms. We compute the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves using simulated data to quantify sensitivity and specificity for various levels of signal-to-noise ratio and different sizes of abnormalities. We also characterize their performance on chromosomal regions of interest in a real dataset obtained from patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme. While comparisons of this type are difficult due to possibly sub-optimal choice of parameters in the methods, they nevertheless reveal general characteristics that are helpful to the biological investigator.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Array CGH technologies enable the simultaneous measurement of DNA copy number for thousands of sites on a genome. We developed the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to divide the genome into regions of equal copy number. The algorithm tests for change-points using a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution to obtain the corresponding P-value. The number of computations required for the maximal test statistic is O(N2), where N is the number of markers. This makes the full permutation approach computationally prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of thousands markers and highlights the need for a faster algorithm. RESULTS: We present a hybrid approach to obtain the P-value of the test statistic in linear time. We also introduce a rule for stopping early when there is strong evidence for the presence of a change. We show through simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial gain in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and that the stopping rule further increases speed. We also present the analyses of array CGH data from breast cancer cell lines to show the impact of the new approaches on the analysis of real data. AVAILABILITY: An R version of the CBS algorithm has been implemented in the "DNAcopy" package of the Bioconductor project. The proposed hybrid method for the P-value is available in version 1.2.1 or higher and the stopping rule for declaring a change early is available in version 1.5.1 or higher.},

@article{zhang08detecting,
	Abstract = {We discuss the detection of local signals that occur at the same location in multiple one-dimensional noisy sequences, with particular attention to relatively weak signals that may occur in only a fraction of the sequences. We propose simple scan and segmentation algorithms based on the sum of the chi-squared statistics for each individual sample, which is equivalent to the generalized likelihood ratio for a model where the errors in each sample are independent. The simple geometry of the statistic allows us to derive accurate analytic approximations to the significance level of such scans. The formulation of the model is motivated by the biological problem of detecting recurrent DNA copy number variants in multiple samples. We show using replicates and parent-child comparisons that pooling data across samples results in more accurate detection of copy number variants. We also apply the multisample segmentation algorithm to the analysis of a cohort of tumour samples containing complex nested and overlapping copy number aberrations, for which our method gives a sparse and intuitive cross-sample summary.},

@article{picard05a-statistical,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray-CGH experiments are used to detect and map chromosomal imbalances, by hybridizing targets of genomic DNA from a test and a reference sample to sequences immobilized on a slide. These probes are genomic DNA sequences (BACs) that are mapped on the genome. The signal has a spatial coherence that can be handled by specific statistical tools. Segmentation methods seem to be a natural framework for this purpose. A CGH profile can be viewed as a succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions in the genome whose BACs share the same relative copy number on average. We model a CGH profile by a random Gaussian process whose distribution parameters are affected by abrupt changes at unknown coordinates. Two major problems arise: to determine which parameters are affected by the abrupt changes (the mean and the variance, or the mean only), and the selection of the number of segments in the profile. RESULTS: We demonstrate that existing methods for estimating the number of segments are not well adapted in the case of array CGH data, and we propose an adaptive criterion that detects previously mapped chromosomal aberrations. The performances of this method are discussed based on simulations and publicly available data sets. Then we discuss the choice of modeling for array CGH data and show that the model with a homogeneous variance is adapted to this context. CONCLUSIONS: Array CGH data analysis is an emerging field that needs appropriate statistical tools. Process segmentation and model selection provide a theoretical framework that allows precise biological interpretations. Adaptive methods for model selection give promising results concerning the estimation of the number of altered regions on the genome.},

	Abstract = {Multiple change-point detection models assume that the observed data is a realization of an independent random process affected by K-1 abrupt changes, called change-points, at some unknown positions. For off-line detection a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm retrieves the K-1 change-points minimizing the quadratic loss and reduces the complexity from $\Theta$(n\^{}K) to $\Theta$(Kn\^{}2) where n is the number of observations. The quadratic complexity in n still restricts the use of such an algorithm to small or intermediate values of n. We propose a pruned DP algorithm that recovers the optimal solution. We demonstrate that at worst the complexity is in O(Kn\^{}2) time and O(Kn) space and is therefore at worst equivalent to the classical DP algorithm. We show empirically that the run-time of our proposed algorithm is drastically reduced compared to the classical DP algorithm. More precisely, our algorithm is able to process a million points in a matter of minutes compared to several days with the classical DP algorithm. Moreover, the principle of the proposed algorithm can be extended to other convex losses (for example the Poisson loss) and as the algorithm process one observation after the other it could be adapted for on-line problems.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:SNP arrays output two signals that reflect the total genomic copy number (LRR) and the allelic ratio (BAF), which in combination allow the characterisation of allele-specific copy numbers (ASCNs). While methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been extended from array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) to jointly handle the two signals, only one method based on change-point detection, ASCAT, performs bivariate segmentation.RESULTS:In the present work, we introduce a generic framework for bivariate segmentation of SNP array data for ASCN analysis. For the matter, we discuss the characteristics of the typically applied BAF transformation and how they affect segmentation, introduce concepts of multivariate time series analysis that are of concern in this field and discuss the appropriate formulation of the problem. The framework is implemented in a method named CnaStruct, the bivariate form of the structural change model (SCM), which has been successfully applied to transcriptome mapping and aCGH.CONCLUSIONS:On a comprehensive synthetic dataset, we show that CnaStruct outperforms the segmentation of existing ASCN analysis methods. Furthermore, CnaStruct can be integrated into the workflows of several ASCN analysis tools in order to improve their performance, specially on tumour samples highly contaminated by normal cells.},
